# Financial Planning and Analysis Fundamentals

## Budgeting Processes
- Zero-based budgeting: Build budget from scratch each period
- Incremental budgeting: Adjust prior period budgets incrementally
- Activity-based budgeting: Link costs to activities and outputs
- Rolling forecasts: Update budgets on a continuous basis
- Scenario-based budgeting: Prepare for multiple potential outcomes
- Top-down vs. bottom-up approaches: Balance strategic direction with operational input

## Financial Forecasting
- Revenue forecasting methods: Historical trends, market analysis, sales pipeline
- Cost projections: Fixed vs. variable cost analysis
- Cash flow forecasting: Timing of receipts and disbursements
- Sensitivity analysis: Impact of changing key variables
- Statistical forecasting: Regression analysis, moving averages, exponential smoothing
- Driver-based forecasting: Link financial projections to operational metrics

## Financial Modeling
- Three-statement models: Integrated income statement, balance sheet, and cash flow
- Discounted cash flow (DCF) models: Present value of future cash flows
- Scenario and sensitivity analysis: Test different assumptions
- Monte Carlo simulation: Probabilistic outcomes based on variable inputs
- Working capital models: Optimize inventory, receivables, and payables
- Capital structure optimization: Determine ideal debt-to-equity ratios

## Management Reporting
- Dashboards and KPIs: Visual representation of key metrics
- Variance analysis: Comparing actual results to budget or forecast
- Contribution margin reporting: Profitability by product, customer, or segment
- Balanced scorecard approach: Financial and non-financial measures
- Executive summaries: Concise overview of financial performance
- Data visualization best practices: Effective communication of financial data

## Cost Management
- Cost classification: Fixed, variable, semi-variable, direct, indirect
- Activity-based costing: Allocate overhead based on activities
- Target costing: Design to cost based on market requirements
- Life-cycle costing: Consider all costs over product/service lifetime
- Value chain analysis: Identify opportunities for cost advantage
- Cost-volume-profit analysis: Break-even points and contribution margins

## Capital Investment Analysis
- Net present value (NPV): Discounted cash flow evaluation
- Internal rate of return (IRR): Return percentage of an investment
- Payback period: Time required to recover initial investment
- Return on invested capital (ROIC): Measure of investment efficiency
- Hurdle rate determination: Required return for investment approval
- Post-implementation reviews: Evaluate actual vs. projected returns

## Working Capital Management
- Cash conversion cycle optimization: Reduce time cash is tied up
- Inventory management: Economic order quantity, just-in-time approaches
- Accounts receivable management: Credit terms, collection policies
- Accounts payable optimization: Supplier terms, payment timing
- Short-term cash management: Investing excess cash, managing shortfalls
- Working capital metrics: Current ratio, quick ratio, working capital turnover

## Risk Management
- Sensitivity analysis: Impact of changing key variables
- Scenario planning: Prepare for different economic environments
- Hedging strategies: Mitigate foreign exchange, interest rate, commodity risks
- Insurance and risk transfer: Protect against insurable risks
- Contingency planning: Prepare for unexpected events
- Enterprise risk management: Holistic approach to managing various risks

## Performance Measurement
- Key performance indicators (KPIs): Financial and operational metrics
- Economic value added (EVA): Economic profit after cost of capital
- Balanced scorecard: Financial, customer, internal process, learning measures
- Return on investment (ROI) analysis: Measuring return on various investments
- Benchmarking: Comparing performance to industry standards
- Incentive compensation alignment: Link rewards to performance metrics

## Strategic Financial Analysis
- SWOT analysis with financial implications
- Competitive financial analysis: Benchmarking against peers
- Merger and acquisition evaluation: Synergy potential, integration costs
- Business unit portfolio analysis: Allocate resources to maximize returns
- Pricing strategy analysis: Impact on margins and market position
- Long-term capital structure planning: Optimize cost of capital
